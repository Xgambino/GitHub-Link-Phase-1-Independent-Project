              <h3>Photographer</h3>
              <p>
                 I am a photographer who absolutely loves his
                job and everything that comes with it. I appreciate the diversity in
                the different people I meet, the places I go, the hours I keep, and
                the spontaneity in every shoot. I appreciate the raw reality of
                everyday life, the fleeting beauty of those in between moments, and I
                do my very best to take every picture with that in mind. I want my
                viewers to relate to my photographs through recognition and
                familiarity with the situations, the emotions, and the energy so much
                that they wonder if they are looking at a picture of someone they
                know.

              <h1>THE PROCESS</h1>
              <p>
                Working with us is extremely easy! The process is simple and
                straightforward as follows:
              </p>
              <h2>1. Pre-Shoot Consultation:</h2>
              <p>
                Every shoot is different, customized to our clients’ preferences, so
                prior consultation helps be sure we understand what you’re looking for
                and walk you through the process. 
                
                We often speak with the clients by
                phone and/or meet in person ahead of time to review examples of what
                they’re looking for. 
                
                Using this form, you can send us sample photos
                and/or links you find in our portfolio or elsewhere that you might
                like to recreate during our photo shoot. 
                
                That’s especially helpful to help us prepare for your shoot.
              </p>
      
              <h2>2. Pick a Date for the Photo Shoot:</h2>
              <p>
                It’s important to give yourself plenty of time in advance of your
                deadline. We recommend an absolute minimum of one week. Add at least
                an additional two weeks if you want a photo album, framed print or
                other printed product. (We can provide rush service for an additional
                fee of KES2000)
              </p>
              <h2>3. The “Paperwork”:</h2>
              <p>
                Once you select a date/time for the shoot, you're required to pay at
                least 50% of the price of the bouquet of your interest. Once received,
                we’ll book the studio time and confirm your shoot. (We can’t confirm
                your shoot until we receive your deposit.)
              </p>
              <h2>4. The Shoot!:</h2>
              <p>
                The shoot will be carried out in the venue of your convenience. We
                arrive at least an hour prior to set up the venue. If you’ve requested
                a makeup artist, s/he will meet you at the studio at the beginning of
                your session.
